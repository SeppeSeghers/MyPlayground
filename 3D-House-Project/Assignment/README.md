# 3D House Project

- Repository: `3D_houses`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning & Consolidation`
- Duration: `2 weeks`
- Deadline: `20/07/20 9:00 AM`
- Deployment strategy :
	 Github page
	| Powerpoint
	| Jupyter Notebook
	| Webpage
	| App
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Mission objectives 
Consolidate the knowledge in Python, specifically in :
- NumPy
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib

## Learning Objectives 

- to be able to search and implement new librairies
- to be able to read and use shapefiles
- to be able to read and use geoTIFFs 
- to be able to render a 3D plot
- to be able to present a final product


## The Mission

> We are LIDAR PLANES , active in the Geospatial industy. We would like to use our data to launch a new branch in the insurrance business.  So, we need you to build a solution with our data to model a house in 3D with only a home address.

### Must-have features

- 3D lookup of houses.

### Nice-to-have features

- Optimize your solution to have the result as fast as possible.
- Features like the living area of the house in mÂ², how many floors, if there is a pool, the vegetation in the neighborhood, etc...
- Better visualization.

### Miscellaneous information

#### What is LIDAR ?

LIDAR is a method to measure distance using light. The device will illuminate a target with a laser light and a sensor will measure the reflection. Differences in wavelength and return times will be used to get 3D representations of an area.

Here is a LIDAR segmentation :

With those points clouds we can easily identify houses, vegetation, roads, etc...

The results we're insterressed in are DSM (Digital Surface Map) and DTM (Digital Terrain Map).

Which are already computed and available here :

- [DSM](http://www.geopunt.be/download?container=dhm-vlaanderen-ii-dsm-raster-1m&title=Digitaal%20Hoogtemodel%20Vlaanderen%20II,%20DSM,%20raster,%201m)
- [DTM](http://www.geopunt.be/download?container=dhm-vlaanderen-ii-dtm-raster-1m&title=Digitaal%20Hoogtemodel%20Vlaanderen%20II,%20DTM,%20raster,%201m)

## Deliverables

1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the readme file:
	- What, Why, When, How, Who.
	- Pending things to do
	
3. Show us your results in a nice presentation.
4. Show us a live demo

### Steps
1. Create the repository
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Download the maps
4. Identify technical challenges (How ?)

## Evaluation criterias
1. It works (no bugs in the console, no error)
2. You use Git from the start and during the entire process of the development (at least one push per day)
3. You convince us during the final presentation

## A final note of encouragement
