Hey there, welcome to my git repository.
This is just a place I'm using to try out new stuff, and as a playground for the things I've learned.
If you're going through this, keep in mind that it is merely a little test project.

That being said, feel free to check out some of the weird and whacky or completely broken things I made.

I certainly hope you can get a laugh out of it, because I only got pain and frustration.

Sincerely
Seppe Seghers
